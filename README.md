# Energy-Consumption-Forcast
## Time Series Forecast on Energy Consumption using Feedforward Neural Network
Energy consumption prediction of buildings is important not only for building owners but also for utility enterprises to optimize the energy supply structure and improve energy efficiency. Given only weather information nearby, we built a model to forecast the energy consumption of the building.

We built a fully-connected feedforward neural network to forcast the energy consumption of a building using the given realistic time serise data. \n
All the details are explained in the medium article written by our team. \n
